# Product Context

## Purpose
This is a frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The specific functionality isn't detailed yet (dnsspray suggests DNS related tool), but the immediate goal is deployment automation.

## Deployment
The project currently has a `deploy` script using `gh-pages`, but the user wants a GitHub Action workflow to handle this automatically on push.
